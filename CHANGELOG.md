# Changelog

What changed in RosterWarden, newest first. Dates are when each change reached
`main`. Entries before 31 October 2026 were written afterwards from the merged
pull requests, which are linked so the full detail is one click away.

## 31 October 2026

All in [#35].

- A roster covering a whole month now follows on to the same days across the
  whole next month. Before, it moved on five weeks, so the next one started a
  few days late and ran into the month after.
- *Things to check* flags anyone rostered on a day they aren't available (put
  on by hand, kept by a lock, or their days changed since), not only people who
  are away.
- In **Edit**, *Days on this roster* is a calendar of the roster's dates: tap
  one to add it or take it off. **Undo** brings a day back.
- The list of rosters sorts **Newest first** or **Oldest first**.
- "Usually off" in the hand-edit pickers now respects weeks of the month, not
  just the weekday.
- **Send out to pick:** on New Roster, the picked dates' empty shifts go out on
  everyone's staff link. The first to tap *I'll take it* gets a shift, and
  *Can't do this day* becomes an away date. You see who took what and who
  hasn't answered, and *Build from these* locks the taken shifts in.
- **Email everyone:** under Send, one tap emails each person on a roster just
  their own shifts, after a screen listing who gets one and who's skipped.
  Emails come from "*your workplace* via RosterWarden", and replies go to the
  business email set in Settings.
- Removed old code nothing used any more (the plain-text table and leftover
  sync-code helpers).

## 30 October 2026

- **Close this page** on a staff page also makes the device forget it, so the
  app icon opens the ordinary app again ([#34]).
- Staff who also run rosters of their own can get from the staff page to their
  own rosters ([#33]).
- Settings drops the sync code and backup screens, now that an account keeps
  the code. **Delete all data** and **Sign out** sit at the foot ([#32]).
- Staff pages show only a hint of the person's email and mobile, so a
  forwarded link doesn't give them away ([#31]).
- Staff replies show up while the app is open. **Delete all data** switches
  off old staff links ([#30]).
- The app bar shows who is signed in. **Delete all data** forgets a remembered
  staff link ([#29]).
- Signing in goes straight to the site and back, with no code to copy and no
  Approve step ([#24], [#28]). The welcome screen says who is signed in ([#27]).
- Fixes for the app reopening on a remembered staff link, and a **Close this
  page** exit on staff pages ([#25], [#26]).
- **Accounts:** sign in with Google, Microsoft or email to keep your rosters
  safe across devices. Simpler person screen and setup wizard, and slide
  transitions ([#23]).
- Staff can edit their own name, email and mobile from their link. New people
  get a staff link automatically. An **Updates** log, and the main actions in a
  bar at the foot of the screen ([#22]).

## 29 October 2026

- Staff confirm or decline each of their shifts from their own link ([#21]).
- **Shifts and events:** a roster keeps its own shifts for each day. Shifts
  can run on chosen days only. A built roster's shifts can be changed day by
  day, and each day's shifts can be planned before building. One-offs are
  called events and don't carry forward. A catering starting point
  ([#16], [#17], [#18], [#19], [#20]).
- A sync code can be entered from the welcome screen, even with sync already
  on ([#15]).

## 24 October 2026

- **Shift swaps:** staff can ask a colleague to take a shift, with or without
  the owner's approval, and the owner can swap people across any day ([#14]).

## 23 October 2026

- New Roster starts with the weeks after your last roster already picked
  ([#13]).

## 22 October 2026

- **+ add** beside any gap on a roster fills it without going into Edit
  ([#12]).
- A simpler flow: pick dates, **Build**, done. The built roster is saved and
  opens on the Roster screen ([#11]).
- An optional step-by-step setup wizard, and rosters filled in by hand with
  **Fill the rest for me** ([#10]).

## 20 October 2026

- The app is hosted at <https://rosterwarden.sixthdaystudios.com/> ([#8]).
- **Staff availability links:** each person gets a private link to mark the
  dates they can't work, with no login ([#7]).
- README brought up to date ([#9]).

## 18 October 2026

First release of the web app, rebuilt from the Rosterm8 desktop app (see
`legacy-desktop/CHANGELOG.md` for its history).

- **Roles inside shifts**, such as barista and cashier, or lead singer and
  drums. People tick the roles they can do, and the hardest role is filled
  first ([#1]).
- The **Team** tab (People, Shifts, Skills), set-up sheets, and a quicker
  roster builder ([#2]).
- New people are available every day until marked otherwise ([#3]).
- Sections fold away, tap a name to replace or swap them, and rosters can be
  sent to Planning Center with a preview ([#4]).
- Fairness counts turns across recent rosters. Hand-made changes are locked,
  there is **Undo**, and Planning Center replies come back ([#5]).
- Church rules: people who serve together, how often someone serves, and
  weeks of the month. Per-person messages, hours and estimated pay, people
  search and bulk edit ([#6]).
