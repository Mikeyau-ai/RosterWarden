# RosterWarden

**Fair staff rosters in seconds, on your phone.** From [Sixth Day Studios](https://sixthdaystudios.com),
alongside InvoiceWarden and RamWarden. Formerly **Rosterm8** (renamed 2026-10).

Add your people, set up your shifts and the roles inside them, note who's away
and who shouldn't be paired up, then press **Build roster**. RosterWarden spreads
the shifts fairly, honours every constraint you gave it, and tells you plainly
when it couldn't fill something rather than quietly fudging it. Staff can send
the dates they can't work through their own private link.

Built for a small church cafe's casual weekend roster, but nothing in it is
specific to that: it handles any set of named shifts and roles on any days of
the week, from a cafe to a worship band to a catering crew. Churches on
**Planning Center** can bring a Services team, its positions and everyone's
blockout dates straight in, and send finished rosters back into their plans.

## Using it

Open <https://rosterwarden.sixthdaystudios.com/>, tap **Add to Home Screen**
(Safari: Share → Add to Home Screen; Chrome: menu → Install app), and it behaves
like an installed app: full screen, its own icon, and it works with no signal.

Four sections:

- **Roster**: the rosters you've saved. This is what you open it to look at.
- **New Roster**: the calendar and the Build button.
- **Team**: People, Shifts (with their roles), and Skills, a grid of who can do
  which role.
- **Settings**, in three groups:
  - *Your workplace*: Name and opening hours
  - *Connections*: Planning Center, AI assist
  - *App*: Sync and backup, Add to Home Screen, About

1. **Name your workplace** on the welcome screen and pick a starting point: a
   cafe (one shift of two people), a worship team (a service with lead singer,
   backup singers, guitars, bass, drums and keys) or blank. You can have more
   than one workplace; the dropdown at the top switches between them.

   Or tap **Walk me through it step by step** for the setup wizard: name and
   starting point, opening days and hours, shifts and their roles, the team (a
   pasted list), and who can do which role, then a summary before anything is
   created. Cancelling part-way keeps nothing. It is also under **Settings →
   Set up a new workplace** and **+ New organisation, step by step…** in the
   dropdown. Steps 2–4 below are what it fills in for you.
2. **People** (Team tab): everyone starts available every day; untick the days
   they can't do. **Add several** takes a pasted list of names (one per line,
   with an optional `- Sat, Sun`). Or bring a team in from Planning Center
   (below). Once the list is long there's a search box, and **Select several**
   sets days, ticks a role, or pauses people in one go.
3. **Shifts** (Team tab): the blocks of work a day is made of, e.g. `Cafe
   08:00–12:00, 2 people needed`, filled in the order listed. **Copy** duplicates
   a shift with its roles.
4. **New Roster**: tap the dates on the calendar, press **Build**. The
   "4 people · 2 shifts · Who can do what" buttons open the Team screen over the
   roster you're building, so fixing set-up never loses your dates. Save it and
   it appears under **Roster**.

   To choose everyone yourself, press **Fill in by hand** instead: the roster
   opens empty in the editor, with a "+ add" picker on every place listing who
   is free that day and can do the role. **Fill the rest for me** keeps everyone
   you placed (locked) and lets the scheduler fill the gaps fairly.

### A person's page

Besides their name and the days they can work, each person can have:

- **How often**: as often as needed, every 2nd or 3rd week at most, or about once
  a month. A preference: they're still used if nobody else is free.
- **Only these weeks of the month**: e.g. the 1st and 3rd Sunday. A date they
  asked for overrides it.
- **Roles** they can do (also on the Skills grid), **asked to work** dates, a
  **max shifts** per roster, and **away dates**.
- **Never with** (kept apart) and **Serves with** (a couple or a parent and
  child: when one is rostered, the other goes on the same shift if they're free
  and can do a place left on it).
- **Their availability link** (see Staff availability links below).
- An optional **mobile**, **email** and **pay per hour**.

### Roles inside shifts

A shift can list the roles it needs and how many of each (`Lead singer × 1,
Drums × 1`); its "Staff needed" is then their total. People are only put on roles
they're ticked for, except roles marked **anyone can do it** (serving, set-up).
The role nobody else can fill is filled first, so the only drummer isn't used
up on backing vocals. Roles belong to the workplace, so "Guitar" on the 9am and
11am services is one role and one tick per person.

### After building

- **Things to check** (folded until opened) lists what couldn't be done.
  **Fill the gaps** turns "Drums: short on 2 days" into a picker of who else
  could do it: choosing one ticks them for the role and rebuilds.
- **Tap any name** to replace them with someone free that day who can do the
  role, swap them with someone else on that day, take them off, or lock them in.
  A hand-made change is locked (🔒), and **Rebuild around locked** keeps it while
  refilling the rest. **Undo** steps back through edits and swaps.
- **Share / export**: a group message, each person's shifts, **Message each
  person** (their own dates, with Text and Email buttons when you've saved their
  mobile or email), print or PDF, a calendar file, a spreadsheet, and Planning
  Center (below).
- The tally shows shifts and hours per person, and an estimated pay total when
  anyone has a pay rate.
- On a saved roster, **Next one** starts a draft with the same days moved on by
  whole weeks. Saved rosters re-check themselves when opened, so someone who is
  now away on a day they're rostered shows up in Things to check.

Every section (the calendar, requests, the roster, the warnings) folds away
with its arrow; everything starts open except the warnings.

### Staff availability links

Each person can get a private link to tell you the dates they can't work, with
no login. On their page: **Create link**, then **Email**, **Text**, **Share** or
**Copy** sends it from your own phone, and RosterWarden notes when and how it was
sent. The link opens a page with just their name, their upcoming shifts, a
calendar to tap the dates they can't work, and a note.

Your app picks up what they sent when it opens and whenever you come back to it
(or straight away with **Check now**). Their dates become away dates marked
"from their link", replacing what they sent before; away dates you entered are
never touched. A new date that clashes with a saved roster is announced. **Clear
them** removes only their dates, and **Make a new link** cancels the old link for
good while keeping their dates.

The key is in the link after the `#`, which browsers never send to a server.
What they enter, and the name and shifts on their page, are encrypted with it
and stored in two small mailboxes on the sync worker, which can't read them.
Your copy of each key lives in your own (encrypted) data.

### Opening days and hours

**Settings → Name and opening hours**:

- **Open on**: the days you normally trade. Everything else is dimmed on the
  roster calendar, and an **All open days** shortcut appears. Dimmed, not
  blocked: you can still pick a closed day for a one-off, and it shows dashed.
- **Opening hours**: fill in the times when you add a new shift.

Time fields step in 5-minute blocks, which is far quicker on a phone.

### Picking dates

The calendar takes exact dates rather than a repeating rule, because real
rosters aren't a clean pattern. The bulk buttons under each month (All open
days, Saturdays, Weekends...) keep the ordinary case quick; tap a single date to
switch it off, and tap a bulk button again to clear what it selected.

**Repeat weekly** carries the first week's pattern forward, by number of weeks
or to an end date. It's recalculated each time, so dropping 12 weeks to 4 takes
the later dates back off.

### Requests and days off

Under the calendar, **Requests and days off** lists everyone against the picked
dates: tap a date to cycle *asked to work → can't work → nothing*. With an AI
key set, you can also paste a message there ("Sarah can only do Saturdays, Tom's
away 5–9 June") and approve what it read before anything is saved.

## Planning Center

**Settings → Planning Center → Connect Planning Center** signs in with the
person's own Planning Center login (OAuth). Then:

- **Team**: pick the Services team you roster for this workplace.
- **Update from Planning Center**: adds anyone new on the team (matching
  existing people by name first, so a list typed by hand is linked, not
  duplicated) and replaces everyone's Planning Center blockouts with the current
  ones, including repeating blockouts. Away dates you typed yourself are never
  touched. The days each person can work are still set in RosterWarden.
- **Add positions from Planning Center** (on a shift): the team's positions
  become roles on that shift, each sent back as the same position, and everyone
  is ticked for the positions Planning Center has them down for.
- **Send each shift as**: the team position each shift fills (e.g. Cafe →
  Barista). A role can have its own position, which wins over its shift's.
- **Share / export → Planning Center → Send…**: first reads Planning Center and
  shows what would happen (how many go into how many plans, who's already there,
  who isn't on the team, shifts with no position, dates with no plan), then asks
  whether to notify. Everyone is added as **Unconfirmed**, with notifications
  *prepared but not sent*: nobody hears anything until you press Send in
  Planning Center. Sending twice doesn't double anyone up.
- **Check replies** (same place): reads who confirmed, is waiting or declined,
  marks names with ✓ or ✕, and lists anyone who declined with a **Replace**
  button. Reads only.

Each device signs in for itself; the token stays on that device and is not in
backups or sync. Sign-in uses PKCE and a `state` check, and **Disconnect**
revokes the token with Planning Center rather than just forgetting it. API calls
read Planning Center's rate-limit headers and wait out a 429. The app talks to Planning Center directly, except for the
sign-in swap, which needs the app's client secret and so goes through the sync
worker (see `worker/README.md`). With `PCO_CLIENT_ID` empty in `js/config.js`
the card just says Planning Center isn't set up.

### Setting it up (once)

1. Make a free Planning Center organisation for Sixth Day Studios (not the
   church's), as its Organization Administrator: Planning Center's own advice,
   since only org admins can create OAuth apps and every admin of that org can
   manage it. Create **one** OAuth application there at
   <https://api.planningcenteronline.com/oauth/applications>, with callback URLs
   `https://rosterwarden.sixthdaystudios.com/` and `http://localhost:8123/`.
   Every church then signs in through that one app; none of them register
   anything. The free org can also hold sample data to test against.
2. Put the client id in `js/config.js` (`PCO_CLIENT_ID`) and
   `worker/wrangler.toml` (`PCO_CLIENT_ID`).
3. From `worker/`: `npx wrangler secret put PCO_CLIENT_SECRET`, then
   `npx wrangler deploy`.

**Never put the secret (or a personal access token) in the app's own files.**
This is a public static site: anything in it can be read by anyone.

## Backups and sync

With **sync** on (the default when a sync server is configured), your data is
encrypted on the device and kept on the server, which stores it but cannot read
it. Your **sync code** brings everything back on a new phone. **Lose the code and
the data is gone**: nobody else has ever held the key, which is the point.

Without sync, everything is in this browser's storage only, and **clearing your
browsing data erases it**. Use **Settings → Sync and backup → Export backup** now
and then; **Restore from backup** puts it all back.

## The scheduler

`js/scheduler.js` is the part that matters, and it is deliberately boring:
given the same inputs it always produces the same roster. No AI, no randomness.

For each vacancy it ranks everyone who is eligible by

1. whether they asked for that date: requests go first
2. whether they'd rather serve less often and served too recently: they go
   behind everyone else, but are still used if nobody else is left
3. fewest shifts: this roster's plus those in saved rosters from the 90 days
   before it, so fairness carries from one roster to the next
4. longest since they last worked: spread the days out
5. name: a stable tiebreak, so the result never changes between runs

and takes the top candidate. It works from the exact dates picked, and enforces
weekly and week-of-month availability, away dates, "never together" pairs, roles,
an optional per-person cap (counted within the roster), and one shift per person
per day. Requested dates override the weekday and week-of-month patterns. A
shift's roles are filled hardest first; a partner who serves with someone joins
them on the same shift when they can; locked places are kept and only the rest
is filled. Anything it can't satisfy becomes a note on the roster instead of a
silent gap.

## The AI bit is optional

**Settings → AI assist** turns pasted messages into ticked days, away dates and
clash pairs for you to approve. Names it doesn't recognise are thrown away. It
never decides who works when. Supported: Gemini, Anthropic and OpenAI; the key is
stored on this device only (fine for a personal phone, not a shared one).

## Running it locally

A static site with no build step:

```bash
python dev-server.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:8123`. `dev-server.py` sends no-cache headers so an
edit always shows, and the service worker is skipped on localhost for the same
reason. Tests:

```bash
node --test tests/*.mjs
```

`legacy-desktop/` holds the original Windows app this replaced (still called
Rosterm8). It is no longer developed.

## Deploying

The app lives at <https://rosterwarden.sixthdaystudios.com/>, served as static
files by Cloudflare (`wrangler.jsonc`). Deploy from `main` with
`python wr.py deploy`: it copies just the app (`index.html`, the manifest,
`sw.js`, `css/`, `js/`, `icons/`) into `dist/` and publishes that, using the
Cloudflare token in Guardian's `.env`. Merging to `main` does not deploy by
itself. The old `mikeyau-ai.github.io/RosterWarden/` address is a redirect,
served from the `gh-pages` branch, that keeps any `#staff=` link part. The service
worker serves the cached copy first and refreshes in the background; when that
finds a changed file the open page reloads onto it within seconds. Add any new
file to the `SHELL` list in `sw.js` so it works offline.
